# NTP Exporter

This project provides an RPM package for exporting NTP server metrics as Prometheus-compatible metrics.

## Features
- Automatically extracts the NTP server from `chronyc`.
- Exports the data via Node Exporter's textfile collector.
- Installs systemd configuration and cron job.

## Installation
1. Build the RPM:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -ba SPECS/ntp_exporter.spec


How to Use setup_monitoring.sh  Script
Copy and save it as setup_monitoring.sh.
Make it executable:
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x setup_monitoring.sh
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ./setup_monitoring.sh
What This Script Does
âœ… Installs Node Exporter and sets it up as a systemd service
âœ… Sets up NTP Exporter and configures it to run every minute via cron
âœ… Sets up License Days Exporter and configures it to run every minute via cron
âœ… Creates necessary directories (/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector)
âœ… Ensures proper permissions and ownership
âœ… Starts all services and verifies their status
âœ… Checks if metrics are being generated correctly

This single script automates everything, so you donâ€™t need to run multiple scripts manually. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸ˜Š
